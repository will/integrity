Try it!
-------

    $ git clone git://github.com/integrity/integrity.git
    $ rake launch
    $ open http://0.0.0.0:4567/

Run the test suite
------------------

1. Ensure you have `gems.github.com` in your gem sources:
   `gem sources -a http://gems.github.com`
2. Install the runtime and development dependencies:
   `gem build integrity.gemspec && gem install *.gem --development`.
3. Run the test suite: `rake test`

Why we don't `require "rubygems"`
---------------------------------

We decided to leave that choice up to the user. For more information, please
