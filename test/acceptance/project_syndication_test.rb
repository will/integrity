    As a user,
    I want to subscribe to a public project's Atom feed
    So I can know the status of my favorite projects while having my morning coffee

  scenario "a public project's page includes an autodiscovery link tag for the feed" do
    Project.gen(:integrity, :public => true)

    Project.gen(:integrity, :public => true, :commits => commits)

    visit "/integrity.atom"
